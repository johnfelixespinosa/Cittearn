  lyrics:     "On the corner of main street\r\nJust tryin' to keep it in line\r\nYou say you wanna move on and\r\nYou say I'm falling behind\r\n\r\nCan you read my mind?\r\nCan you read my mind?\r\n\r\nI never really gave up on\r\nBreakin' out of this two-star town\r\nI got the green light\r\nI got a little fight\r\nI'm gonna turn this thing around\r\n\r\nCan you read my mind?\r\nCan you read my mind?\r\n\r\nThe good old days, the honest man;\r\nThe restless heart, the Promised Land\r\nA subtle kiss that no one sees;\r\nA broken wrist and a big trapeze\r\n\r\nOh well I don't mind, if you don't mind\r\n'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine\r\nBefore you go, can you read my mind?\r\n\r\nIt’s funny how you just break down\r\nWaitin' on some sign\r\nI pull up to the front of your driveway\r\nWith magic soakin' my spine\r\n\r\nCan you read my mind?\r\nCan you read my mind?\r\n\r\nThe teenage queen, the loaded gun;\r\nThe drop dead dream, the Chosen One\r\nA southern drawl, a world unseen;\r\nA city wall and a trampoline\r\n\r\nOh well I don't mind, if you don't mind\r\n'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine\r\nBefore you jump\r\nTell me what you find when you read my mind\r\n\r\nSlippin’ in my faith until I fall\r\nYou never returned that call\r\nWoman, open the door, don't let it sting\r\nI wanna breathe that fire again\r\n\r\nShe said I don't mind, if you don't mind\r\n'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine\r\n\r\nPut your back on me\r\nPut your back on me\r\nPut your back on me\r\n\r\nThe stars are blazing like rebel diamonds cut out of the sun\r\nWhen you read my mind"
